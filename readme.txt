Bogo extension library to create multilingual plugins or plugins that make other plugins multilingual.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a library of extended functionality for Bogo. My Bogo based translation plugins depend on it.

If you are developing a plugin and wish to make it compatible to Bogo, you may find some convenient API calls in here.

It also contains an email localization implementation that can localize emails depending on the user who receives them.

For example usages see [Bogo BBPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bogo-bbpress/) or [Bogo BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bogo-buddypress/).
